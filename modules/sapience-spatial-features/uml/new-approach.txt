How to preserve the link between the Feature Source (e.g. the KML object) and 
the extracted Feature Collection? Use Case: Transforming a kml file into a 
feature collection, buffering the feature geometries according to the semantic
annotations and changing the style according to the geometry. All style 
information resides in the KML since this is standard-specific information, 
whereas the features have to remain as abstract as possible (see ISO GFM)

The result of a parsing process is an object which implements the "FeatureSource" (better 
name required) interface, which means we can call the method asFeature() to get a 
feature representation of the object. The feature is constructed on runtime (but cached


interface FeatureSource
 // returns Feature representation of current object
 public Feature asFeature(FeatureFactory fac);
 // generated feature representation is cached, update triggers a reconstruction
 public void update();  
 
Feature extends FeatureCollection
 // returns a list of features contained by this feature (if it is a container, NoFeatureContainerException otherwise)
 public FeatureCollection listFeatures(boolean recursive)
 
// a feature with a geometry 
SpatialFeature extends Feature
 public Geometry getGeometry
 public Geometry getEnvelope throws NoFeatureContainerException 

// a feature (e.g. an instant) with temporal information
TemporalFeature extends Feature
 // Date is the wrong data type hhere
 public Date getTime
 public TimeSpan getEnvelope throws NoFeature..
 
// a feature in the geographic space (has a temporal dimension)
GeoSpatialFeature extends SpatioTemporalFeature
