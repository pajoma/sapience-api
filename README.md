> *sapience*: the property of possessing or being able to possess wisdom (â€‹Wiktionary)

The Semantic Annotations API (sapience) comprises libraries giving application developers a simple and fast way to extend their applications with semantic functionality. Existing applications with complex and data models usually lack ways to describe the meaning of the data, which unnecessarily impairs the exchange of data across different applications. This is especially the case for Web services serving arbitrary content which have to be integrated into other applications. Due to our background in Geoinformatics, the libraries have a strong focus on supporting the annotation of geospatial content compliant to standards published by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The various libraries have been either developed within scientific research projects, or are results of thesis implementations (ranging from BSC to PhD). The implementations have been refactored and
simplified for sapience.

All libraries are published under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license, which gives you basically the right to do whatever you want as long as you ship the original license and keep the information about the authors.
