Data semantics refers to the real-world meaning of (mostly geospatial) data. One Web service might deliver real-time precipitation data, 
another offers a street network data, a third may produce pollution maps based on a computer model. Shared 
vocabularies help to specify and communicate the meaning of certain characteristics of the data.  
Semantic Annotations establish the link between the content's metadata (e.g. a description of the Web service functionality) and the shared vocabulary. 
These references in the data models point to the concepts, which could refer the real-world entity represented by the data (maybe a <a href="http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept?cp=7272&langcode=en&ns=1">Road</a>), a common
place name in a Gazetteer (maybe <a href="http://www.geonames.org/maps/google_51.508_-0.126.html">London</a>), or any other entity from a controlled
vocabulary. 
</p>
<p>
What kind of external knowledge is required for describing the data semantics depends on the application. Your street data may be used in various contexts such as 
car navigation, noise mapping, wildlife migration, and more. It depends on the context which particular vocabulary you want
to use for your semantic annotations. XML-based metadata describes the structure of the data and the capabilities of Web services 
offering this data.  The semantic annotations proxy dynamically injects references into these XML documents, without the need for the service provider
to create the annotations for himself.

</p>
<p>Accessing the proxy is at simple as it gets. Just add the new parameter "sid" (service identifier) to the URL. If a service with the given ID has
been registered to the proxy, the underlying Web service will be invoked. If there are references to add, we go through the streaming data and inject the reference
by pausing the data stream and writing it into it. Quick processing without a noticeable delay of the response was one or our goals. The injection 
procedure is based on a <a href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org/">high-performance XML-processor</a>. The reference locations are stored as namespace-aware 
XPath expressions, which means that even a change of the original source shouldn't affect the injection procedure. </p>
